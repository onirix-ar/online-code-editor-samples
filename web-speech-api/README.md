# Integration with Web Seepech API

Using this example you can integrate Web Speech API with Onirix usign code editor.
Web Speech Api enables you to incorporate voice data into web apps. There are two possibilities, the first is text-to-speech, i.e. the browser will read text, and the second is speech recognition, i.e. the user speaks and the browser processes the words. In this example, the first option is used.

In this example there are two labels called en and es.  Click on each of them to read the text in the corresponding language.
The second parameter can be removed in the function calls as language =navigator.language would take the language of the browser.
